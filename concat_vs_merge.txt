1. Way of combining
concat has axis option default is 0 i.e. vertical stacking i.e. one below another
pd.concat([df1,df2], axis = 0)
df1
df2
pd.concat([df1,df2], axis = 1)
df1 df2

while merge only have horizontal stacking based on on column

2. the keywords used for combining:
Merge use how and concat use join
Join has only two values outer and inner
how has 4 values left, right, inner, outer
